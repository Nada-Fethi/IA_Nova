# NovaIA
NovaIA is a smart voice assistant application built with Python and a modern GUI using PyQt5.
It is designed to interact with users through voice or text, interpret their queries using a Decision-Making Model (DMM), and respond using real-time search or AI-generated answers, while also allowing system automation tasks like opening apps.

 ## Purpose of the Application

Enable voice interaction with the computer.

Automate tasks like launching apps, searching online, or performing system functions.

Provide real-time, internet-based answers using Google search + Groq’s LLM.

Present a clean, modern Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Save and display full chat history visually.
